# Pangrams-algo
This program solves the Pangrams problem by checking whether a string holds all letters of the English alphabet. It works by using a boolean array to keep record of which letters are present, making all characters lowercase for case-insensitive examination. The algorithm returns "pangram" when all 26 letters are found, else "not pangram" when any are missing.
